         <p> JavaScript (also known as NodeJS) is a popular language among developers who need to work on server-side and client-side programming.
 
          It is compatible with several other programming languages, allowing you to create animations, set up buttons, and manage multimedia. 
          Owing to its high speed and regular annual updates, JavaScript is an ultimate hit in the IT domain. Reputed firms like Netflix,
          
          Uber, PayPal, and several startups use JavaScript to create dynamic web pages that are secure and fast.</p>

          JavaScript is omnipresent in todayâ€™s digital environment. Hence, learning this language makes complete sense. </p>
