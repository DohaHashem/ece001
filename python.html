          1.  Python<br>
          <img src="python.png" alt="python"><br>
          <p>Python continues to be one of the best programming languages every developer should learn this year. The language is easy-to-learn
          and offers a clean and well-structured code,making it powerful enough to build a decent web application. 
          Python can be used for web and desktop applications, GUI-based desktop applications, machine learning, data science,
          and network servers. The programming language enjoys immense community support and offers several open-source libraries, frameworks,
          and modules that make application development a cakewalk.</p>
          <p> For instance, Python offers Django and Flask, popular libraries for web development and TensorFlow, Keras,
          and SciPy for data science applications. </p>
          <p>  Though Python has been around for a while, it makes sense to learn this language in 2020 as it can help you get a job or
          a freelance project quickly, thereby accelerating your career growth.</p>
